````

#### 🔹 Java 8 Core Concepts Learned
#### Lambda Expressions
- Learned **lambda expressions** as concise implementations of functional interfaces (SAM).
- Understood **target typing**, **type inference**, and **effectively final variables**.
- Compared **anonymous classes vs lambdas** (`this` behavior).
- Applied lambdas in:
  - Dynamic sorting (`Comparator`), Filtering (`Predicate`), Stream pipelines (`filter`, `map`, `collect`)

#### Method References
- Studied method references as readable alternatives to lambdas.
- Types covered:
  - Static (`Class::method`), Instance (`obj::method`), Unbound (`Class::instanceMethod`), Constructor (`Class::new`)
- Learned overload ambiguity handling and when to prefer lambdas.

#### Interfaces & Java 8 Enhancements
- Deep understanding of **@FunctionalInterface** and SAM conversion.
- Used built-in interfaces:
  - `Supplier`, `Consumer`, `Function`, `Predicate`
  - `UnaryOperator`, `BinaryOperator`, `Comparator`
- Created custom functional interfaces with default methods.
- **Default methods** for backward compatibility.
- **Static methods** for interface-level utilities.
- Method resolution rules (class wins, conflict resolution).
- Marker interfaces vs **annotations** (modern alternative).
