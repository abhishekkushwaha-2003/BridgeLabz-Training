### 🗓 Day 1 – Java Generics Overview 
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**                    
**Branch:** `java-collections-practice`

Studied the Java Collections Framework to manage groups of objects efficiently using built-in data structures. Learned the difference between Collection and Map interfaces and their real-world use cases.

#### 🔹 Created a new branch `java-collections-practice`
- Learned and applied Java Generics best practices:
  - Generic classes, methods, and constructors
  - Bounded type parameters and wildcards
  - Type safety and reusability

#### 🔹 Topics Learned
- Type safety with generics
- Generic classes, methods, and constructors
- Upper & lower bounded wildcards
- Bounded type parameters
- Avoiding raw types and type erasure pitfalls
- Designing clean and reusable generic APIs
  
#### 🔹 Implemented real-world generic systems:
  - Smart Warehouse Management
  - Online Marketplace
  - Course Management System
  - Meal Plan Generator
  - AI-Driven Resume Screening System
